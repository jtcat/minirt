# Building
This project requires the 42 School [minilibx](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux) library to be present at the root of the project.
Then simply run `make`
# Usage
MiniRT requires a scene description file with an `.rt` extension.

This snippet represents a simple configuration with all possible primitive types:
```
A 0.2    255,255,255
C 130,0,0    0,0,-1    70
L 130,0,-50    0.7    255,255,255
pl 0,-60,0    0,1.0,0    255,0,225
sp 130,25,-100    20    255,0,0
cy 130,0.0,-100.6    0,1.0,0    14.2 30.42    10,0,255
```

Then simply run
`./miniRT scene.rt`
